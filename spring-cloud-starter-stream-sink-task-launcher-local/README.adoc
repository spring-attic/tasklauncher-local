= TaskLauncher Local Sink

This application launches the task application specified in the uri attribute of the `TaskLaunchRequest` contained
in the message that is received.

Any message that does not contain a `TaskLaunchRequest` will log an error.

== Input

=== Headers:

* `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`

=== Payload:

A  byte array containing the `TaskLaunchRequest`

NOTE: The `TaskLaunchRequest` contains the URI of the task jar, the command line arguments, and properties required for the task launch.

== Output

N/A (launches task to the local system).


== Using the TaskLauncher
A tasklauncher is a sink that consumes a `TaskLaunchRequest` message, deploys and launches a task using a Spring
Cloud Deployer.  The task will use the --uri from the message to determine what artifact to deploy as well as the
properties and arguments to execute the task.

Another example would be to use a processor to translate a message from another source into a `TaskLaunchRequest` that
would be sent to the tasklauncher sink.

== Build

```
$ ./mvnw clean install -PgenerateApps
$ cd apps

You can find the corresponding binder based projects here. You can then cd into one one of the folders and
build it:

$ ./mvnw clean package
```

=== Examples

```
java -jar task-launcher-local.jar
```
